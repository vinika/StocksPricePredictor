üîß Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Issue 1: Yahoo Finance Download Error
Error: No data found, symbol may be delisted
Solution:
# Verify ticker symbol is correct
# Check if market is open
# Try a different ticker (e.g., 'MSFT', 'GOOGL')
Issue 2: TensorFlow Import Error
Error: ImportError: cannot import name 'Sequential'
Solution:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
Sequential = keras.models.Sequential
Issue 3: Plotly Not Displaying
Solution:
import plotly.io as pio
pio.renderers.default = "notebook"  # or "jupyterlab"
Issue 4: Memory Error During LSTM Training
Solution:
# Reduce batch size
batch_size=16  # instead of 32

# Or reduce epochs
epochs=25  # instead of 50
Issue 5: Multi-level Column Headers
Already fixed in code - automatically flattens yfinance multi-level columns
 
üöÄ Advanced Usage
Backtesting
Add this code to test historical predictions:
# Split data into multiple time periods

ensemble_prediction = (lstm_pred * 0.4 + 
                       xgb_pred * 0.35 + 
                       arima_pred * 0.25)
Add More Features

# Sector performance
# Economic indicators
Real-time Prediction API
# Deploy model using Flask/FastAPI
# Create REST endpoint for predictions
